Data dashboard for gpx files

I use a raspberry pi running OpenPlotter OS as a chartplotter on my fishing vessel.
In my final semester at university I was able to earn credit for directed study where I worked on using the pi for commercial fishing. 
I decided to use my directed study time to make a data dashboard application for the pi.
I create .gpx files every time I go fishing to record the location of my gear. 
I find it useful to record additional data such as catch from each trap/string, bait used, nights set, etc. as well
Using this application, dashboards can be created from the data mentioned above and can be viewed / manipulated while fishing

My intention with this project was to learn about GUI app development and apply that to something I found useful. Enjoy the demo video below (Which I had to make quite short)
